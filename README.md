# Tic-Tac-Math
A Tic Tac Toe game but done with math

Tic-Tac-Math is a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid; players take turns marking one cell at a time. 
The diﬀerence is that instead of placing Xs and Os on the grid, the players place the numbers 1 to 9. And, instead of trying to make a row, column, or diagonal ﬁlled with 3 Xs or 3 Os, the players try to make a row, column, or diagonal whose cells sum to 15. One wrinkle: each number can only be placed ONCE.
